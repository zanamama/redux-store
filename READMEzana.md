# 22 State Homework: Redux Store

## My goal

For this app, I will be using the open source JavaScript library Redux, the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application.

I will be refactoring an e-commerce platform so that it uses redux.

## User Story

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem. I will be immersing myself into a new technology to solve this problem.
